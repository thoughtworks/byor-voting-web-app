## BUILD YOUR OWN RADAR (aka BYOR)
Thoughtworks builds its own Technology Radar twice a year.
> you can find the latest edition [here](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

We found it so useful that we decided to share the process and build some tools to help every organization run their own radar creation exercise.
> you can find more information about the process and how the tech radar works [here](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor).

Building your own tech radar, invites you to have a conversation across all organizational levels and review your entire technology portfolio. 

This enables you to:
- Objectively assess what's working, and what isn't
- Pollinate innovation across teams and experiment accordingly
- Balance the risk in your technology portfolio
- Work out what kind of technology organization you want to be
- Set a path for future success

Thoughtworks encourages you to run the radar twice a year to keep your organisation aware of the fast changing technologies landscape.


## BYOR-VotingApp

### Main features

The BYOR-VotingApp comes preloaded with around 943 technologies to choose among and 1.860 blips evaluated by Thoughtworks to compare with, extracted from TW TechRadar Vol1 up to Vol20.

If you are planning to use the BYOR creation excercise, the BYOR-VotingApp can help you to:
- [manage one or more BYOR sessions](docs/admin_guide.md#manage-voting-events)
- load a predefined list of technologies to start with, or use the one already preloaded
- let people add a new technology if missing
- [let people vote up to 10 technologies (aka blips)](docs/user_guide.md#vote-for-a-technology)
- let people write comments about blips
- :warning: **[*TODO*]** identify technologies where people disagree on rings and a further decision is needed
- [display the most voted technologies in real-time](docs/admin_guide.md#generate-an-event-word-cloud)
- [display the final tech radar resulting from the votes collected from the participants of the event](docs/admin_guide.md#generate-an-event-tech-radar)
- [show, for matching technologies, the ratings coming from the blips collected alognside with the ones published by Thoughtworks](docs/admin_guide.md#thoughtworks-blips)

All the Data is stored in a MongoDB database.
