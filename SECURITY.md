# Reporting Security Issues

The BYOR-VotingApp team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue:

1.  join [BYOR-VotingApp](https://spectrum.chat/byor-votingapp/) community on Spectrum
1.  send a message to [@zigolab](https://spectrum.chat/users/zigolab) starting with "SECURITY BUG:"

The BYOR-VotingApp team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).
